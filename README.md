## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

I embarked on this project twice, first as a solo endeavor and later with online guidance. As a beginner, I grappled with occasional self-doubt and hesitation, but I've witnessed steady improvement in my skills over time.

Initially, I tackled the project by diving into HTML, setting the foundation, and gradually shaping the layout with CSS. The JavaScript aspect proved more challenging due to my limited experience in this area. To bridge the knowledge gap, I extensively studied textbooks and tutorials, putting theory into practice.

In my second attempt, I sought help online, and the process was revamped. This time, I felt a sense of accomplishment as I executed the project with greater precision. I meticulously noted concepts that eluded me or needed refining.

My journey reflects a step-by-step progression in honing my skills and knowledge, from grasping HTML and CSS fundamentals to delving into the complexities of JavaScript. With each iteration, I'm inching closer to mastering this craft.
